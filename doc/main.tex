\section{Introduction}


\thel  is a navigational-astronomy application, which allows to compute one's position on the surface of the Earth, on both land and sea, based on sextant measurements. \thel is conceived to make the user's life easy, and it is designed for an intuitive and quick use. 

\subsection{Thelemacus is free software}

\thel is ``free software''; this means that everyone is free to use it. The software is not in the public domain \cite{castellana2024thelemacus}; it is copyrighted and there are conditions on its distribution. These conditions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.

\section{Using \thel}

In order to use \thel, the user needs to be familiar with taking a celestial sight with a sextant, please see \cite{bowditch2002the} for details. The results of this measurements will be 
\begin{itemize}
\item The name of the celestial body 
\item If the body is the Sun or the Moon, the limb (`upper', `center' or `lower') of the body which has been considered in the measurement
\item The height of the celestial body over the horizon, expressed in degrees and arcminutes
\item 
\end{itemize}
